A version of Flagmatic with added functionality such as assumptions and stability checks. It is known to work with Sage-9.5.

flagmatic
=============

To install, navigate to the directory with `setup.py` file:

    cd path/to/flagmatic/pkg

Then run the following code to install CSDP solver:

    sage -i csdp

or alternatively, download the CSDP package from [https://projects.coin-or.org/Csdp/](https://projects.coin-or.org/Csdp/) and copy `csdp` to your PATH.

Finally, install Flagmatic with the command below.

    sage -python setup.py install

**POSSIBLE ISSUES:**

* Check whether the installation finished without errors. If you're missing permissions, re-run the last command with sudo privileges.
* Make sure you refresh/restart your Terminal after the install for changes to take effect.
* If you are on a MacOS and are getting an error about a missing `gcc`, install Command Line Tools.

### Running example scripts ###

Make sure that the script begins with `from flagmatic.all import *` or that you have imported everything yourself. Assuming the script is called `test.sage`, navigate to the directory with the script and type

    sage test.sage

Alternatively, you can type the script into the Sage interpreter one line at a time.

### Verifying stability ###

**Sage is needed.** Tested with Sage7.4 on Mac OSX Sierra and Ubuntu 16.04.

Assuming your certificates and inspect_certificate.py are in the same directory and that you have writing permissions there, from that directory type:

    sage -python inspect_certificate.py <cert1> --stability <bound> <tau> <B> [<cert2> [<cert3>]]

(otherwise use full paths for filenames).
The arguments are:
  
* `<cert1>`: filename of the flag algebras certificate for the problem you want to verify stability for, e.g. `c5.js`
* `<bound>`: lower bound for this problem (should match the FA upper bound), e.g. `24/625`
* `<tau>`  : type you chose, e.g. `"3:12"`
* `<B>`    : B-graph you chose, e.g. `"5:1223344551"`
* `<cert2>`: filename of the FA certificate with, additionally, tau forbidden as induced subgraph, e.g. `cert_robust_stab.js`; not needed, if tau = `1:`.
* `<cert3>`: filename of the FA certificate with, additionally, B forbidden as induced subgraph, e.g. `cert_perfect_stab.js`; not needed if Q_tau has corank 1.

**EXAMPLE:**
Prove that if triangles are forbidden, C<sub>5</sub> density is at most 24/625. Prove that this problem is perfectly-C<sub>5</sub>-stable. Given are certificates `c5.js` and `c5_stab.js`.

    sage -python inspect_certificate.py c5.js --stability 24/625 "3:12" "5:1223344551" c5_stab.js

Check the output, it indicates if conditions of the Theorem 7.1 in *Strong forms of stability from flag algebra calculations* are met.

**WARNING:**
When verifying stability for Clebsch Graph, make sure you use the following string: "g:12131415162728292a373b3c3d484b4e4f595c5e5g6a6d6f6g7e7f7g8c8d8g9b9d9fabacaebgcfde". It's hardcoded for speed.
